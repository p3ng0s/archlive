p4p1-ARCH
=========
*A self made linux distro - MUST READ NOT USABLE YET*

![iso_logo](https://github.com/p4p1/p4p1-arch/raw/main/assets/favicon.png)

A linux description with my configuration and software pre-installed. This is basicaly
a dump of my config but can also be seen as a representation of everything I do in one.
the objective is to have an iso sadly it will be a heavy one, that comes with everything
I do and use pre-setup. This is built so that the day I brake my computer recovering
it will be easier. It can also be used by other people that is why it is open-source.
I am detailing bellow how to use everything but just know it is not beginer friendly and
not that it might stay like that for ever. I use everything here daily and represents
my workflow and overall approach to linux and all.

Currently it is non functional the live is there but I want to update a lot more
to this for actual usage. When it is in a functional state I will publish an iso
and detail how to use in more detail.
Please click [this](https://leosmith.xyz/rice/) link for a full detail on my linux config
and an early build of the iso in question.
